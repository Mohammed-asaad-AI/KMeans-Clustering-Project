TITANIC DATA ANALYSIS INSIGHTS

1. Gender and Survival:
   - Females show significantly higher survival rates than males.
   - This reflects the "women and children first" policy during evacuation.

2. Age and Survival:
   - Children (age < 16) had a higher likelihood of survival compared to adults.
   - Indicates possible prioritization of children during rescue.

3. Fare and Survival:
   - Passengers who paid higher fares had higher chances of survival.
   - Suggests a class-based bias, as high-fare passengers often belonged to higher classes.

4. Clustering Evaluation:
   - KMeans achieved reasonable alignment with survival labels (accuracy varies per run).
   - Silhouette Score supports moderate cluster separation.
   - PCA visualizations confirm group separation in reduced dimensional space.
